Digital Forensics Framework
A modular and AI-powered digital forensics framework that automates evidence collection and analysis while ensuring the integrity of the chain of custody using blockchain technology.

Overview
This framework is designed to assist forensic investigators in acquiring, analyzing, and securely storing digital evidence. It integrates AI/ML for pattern recognition, file recovery, and anomaly detection while leveraging blockchain and IPFS for secure evidence logging.

Features
- Automated & Semi-Automated Disk Imaging
- AI/ML-Based Pattern Detection & File Recovery
- Blockchain Integration for Secure Chain of Custody
- IPFS-Based Distributed Evidence Storage
- Error Handling & Logging for Reliability
- Modular Design for Scalability & Customization
